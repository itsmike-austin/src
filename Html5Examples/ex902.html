    <p>I like apples and oranges.

      I also like bananas, mangoes, cherries, apricots, plums, peaches and grapes. You can see other fruits I like <a href="fruitlist.html">here</a>.

      <strong>Warning:</strong> Eating too many oranges can give you heart burn.

      My favorite kind of orange is the mandarin, properly known as <i>citrus reticulata</i>.
      Oranges at the local store cost <s>$1 each</s> $2 for 3.

      I still remember the best apple I ever tasted. I bought it at <time datetime="15:00">3 o'clock</time> on <time datetime="1984-12-7">December 7th</time>.
