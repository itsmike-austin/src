      I like apples and oranges.
      I also like bgananas, mangoes, cherries, apricots, plums, peaches and grapes.
      You can see the other fruits I like <a href="fruitlist.html"> here</a>.

      My favorite kind of orange is the mandarin, properly known as <i>citrus reticulata</i>.
      Oranges at my local store cost <s>$1 each</s> $2 for 3.

    <blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">
      The apple forms a tree that is small and decidious, reaching 3 to 12 meters (9.8 to 39ft) tall, with a broad, often densely twiggy crown.
      The leaves are alternately arranged simple ovals 5 to 12 centimeters (0.79 to 2.0 inches) peticle with anacute tip, serrated margin and a slightly downy underside. Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves. The flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five petaled and 2.5 to 3.5 centimeters (0.93 to 1.4 in) in diameter.
      The center of the fruit contains five capels arranged in a five-point star, each carpel containing one to three seeds, called pips.

      <strong>Warning:</strong> Eating too many oranges can give you heart burn.
