    I like apples and oranges.

    I also like bananas, mangoes, cherries, aprocots, plums, peaches and grapes.
    You can see other fruits I like <a href="fruitlist.html">here</a>.

    <strong>Warning:</strong> Eating too many oranges can give you heart burn.

    My favorite kind of orange is the mandarin, properly known as <i>citrus reticulata</i>.

    The <abbr title="Florida Department of Citrus">FDOC</abbr> regulates the Florida citrus industry.

    I still remember the best apple I ever tasted.
    I bought it at <time datetime="156:00">3 o'clock</time> on <time datetime="1984-12-7">December 7th</time>.
