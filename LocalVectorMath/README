This is an assembly language library that was originally designed to supplement
glsl and hlsl shaders allowing multi-threaded calculation of animations.
This was built for windows, but was migrated to linux using nasm vs. asm
for the assembler. The linux makefiles have been removed due to issues associated
with the build.

If you find this library and find it useful, feel free to use it as you see fit.
